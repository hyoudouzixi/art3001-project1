    <h1>Weely I Blog For ART 3001</h1>
    <h2>By Tony Wang</h2>

    <p>This week is just a week that continuing working on the final project.</p> 
    <p>Probably have not mentioned before, for the final project, I am trying to do pixel game.</p> 
    <p>I have made pixel games before using Unity, but never have a chance to make one using html and css.</p> 
    <p>Just like the things I have done using p5js, my original idea is to use p5js.</p> 
    <p>So I started with doing some research on how to import sprites using p5js.</p> 
    <p>A sprite is a series of one pixelated characters that include its actions in frames.</p> 
    <p>I found how to import them and p5js allows spirtes to be animated.</p> 
    <p>However, I found really hard to create the properties of the sprite to do things like moving left, right, jump.</p> 
    <p>It's easy to just push the sprites and place them on the canvas.</p> 
    <p>So I want to try this in a different direction by just using Javascript.</p> 
    <p>I know that Javascript is one of the early tool to use to create games, so it defintely works.</p> 
    <p>So first I create a canvas using Javascript and also the canvas element in html.</p> 
    <p>And another important element to setup is the player element.</p> 
    <p>By creating a new class called Player, just like what we have talked in class, it is easy to define many features of this new class and use it.</p> 
    <p>For the Player class, I tried to create gravity just like I did in Unity, by adding velocity on the y direction.</p> 
    <p>And other things to figure out is to make the Player move by pressing keys, in this case, w is jump, a is moving left, d is moving right.</p> 
    <p>I added the comments on my code so others can understand them easier.</p> 
    <p>Other things I figured out were things like adding collision and putting the background, making the sprite and edit it as the player element, and so on.</p> 
    <p>It is indeed time consuming when some bugs came up and need to figure out which part I have missed.</p> 
    <p>But overall it is pretty fine to get this little game running.</p>
