    <h1 style="color: white;">Weely C Blog For ART 3001</h1>
    <h2 style="color: white;">By Tony Wang</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">02/05/2023</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">This week we had two classes, and I felt like we focused on reviewing each other's works and the discussions this week.</p> 
    <p style="color: white;">There are many interesting styling css I have not used in my exercises.</p> 
    <p style="color: white;">One interesting work that was created by one of the classmates I still remember is interactive and story telling combined with the user making choices.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">I think the author had created button like this<button onclick="location.href='http://www.google.com'" type="button"> Click here to go to Google </button>which I found is pretty interesting and userful, connecting different html pages with an interactive button that the user can click on.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Of course, there are many other interesting css they use. Like this animated text: </p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12 text-center">
            <h3 class="animate-character"> ART 3001</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p style="color: white;">Pretty cool effect to use.</p>
      <p style="color: white;">And one important thing I get from the class is that there are many cool styling css that are created by other people online and we can look at them, try to understand how they achieve the effects using those lines of code,  then we can use them.</p>
      <p style="color: white;">While I am writting this, one thing that comes to my mind that I catched from class is that using shift+alt+downkey can copy the whole line down which is really convenient</p>
      <p style="color: white;">And this week's dicussion about internet identity is also an interesting topic. In class some of us shared their stories, one story I catched was that someone said about how her grandfather warned her about the danger of the Internet couple years ago but now she is the one warning her grandfather about the fake things or frauds that could appear on the Internet.</p>
      <p style="color: white;">Last but not least, I am really excited for our first project.</p>
