    <h3 style="color: white;">02/12/2023</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">This week we had a lot studio time to work on our first project, so I'd like to use this week's weekly to talk about my progress.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">On Wednesday class, some of the classmates present their ideas and concepts for their projects, but unfortunately I did not quite finish my concepts to be able to present. Instead, I use that as another day to </p>
    <p style="color: white;">Instead, I use that day as another day to complete my ideas.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">I got all my inspirations from the websites that are listed on <a href="https://thefwa.com/">https://thefwa.com/</a></p>
    <p style="color: white;">This website is an international award platform that honors and rewards web designers, developers and agencies around the world for excellence within the field of web design and development.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">There are a lot of websites, so I only took a look at a few.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">I really enjoy like a glitch effect, or cyberpunk effect on the websites, so I decided to do something on this direciton, also adding some interactable part.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">On some of the websites I took a look at, they have a background that can zoom in, zoom out, a 3D part that can click on, so on.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">So my first thought was that I need to create a menu that user can choose which website to go to.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">I create one like I show it on this page, but obviously there are a lot more need to adjust.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Then for the glitch effect, I am thinking about creating small blocks, lines, circles that have animations so that as whole page looks glitching.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">However, for the 3D model I want to put in, it might be more complex, since it is not just a cube. As I searched and wanted to find a way to achieve it, I think it need an external tool.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">So yes, there a lot more that I need to do some research on. Hope it can turn out nice in the end.</p>
