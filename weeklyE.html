    <h1>Weely E Blog For ART 3001</h1>
    <h2>By Tony Wang</h2>
    <h3>03/05/2023</h2>
    <p>For this week, we did presentations of our first project on both Monday and Wednesday.</p> 
    <p>There are many interesting sites built by my classmates, the solving puzzle game one, the eyes mouth one, and some other sites.</p> 
    <p>Obviously, I don't consider mine as completed, I still need to figure out how to create a easy way for users to understand and </p>
    <p>interact with the 3D cube on my index page and also as I added the weeklys, there is a weekly index page also using the cube.</p> 
    <p>I am thinking about adding a external tool of four arrows, each pointing to different direction, and by clicking the arrows </p> 
    <p>and maybe play around a little bit.</p> 
    <p>However, the main effect I want to achieve is still that the user can using the mouse to drag around the cube, so probably I </p> 
    <p>will stick to this one.</p> 
    <p>On Friday we did a little introduction about p5.js, a really useful tool for learning html and building websites.</p> 
    <p>And I just plug that into this page so I can do a little demo here for this week's weekly.</p>
