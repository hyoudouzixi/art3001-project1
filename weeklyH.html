    <p>So after presenting my exercise 5, one thing I need to fix is the object generation for the enemies in my exercise.</p> 
    <p>Since in class, both objects and array are introduced, so I think I am able to try to fix.</p> 
    <p>This is how: </p> 
    <p>First I created a class called Enemy and add things like size of an enemy, positions, and so on.</p> 
    <p>Then I called to generate the enemies in the set up area.</p> 
    <p>With the array of enemies, I can call how many enemies I want to generate.</p> 
    <p>But one thing I am still trying to figure out is to generate infinite enemies if the game started.</p> 
    <p>Seems like if I make a infinite while loop, the website would crash. So I am thinking about writting a function to let it somehow regenerate enemies.</p> 
    <p>For my final project, I am still thinking and planning, but one thing I am sure is that I want to make something new, not remake or improve privous projects or exercises.</p> 
    <p>Something I have in mind is a retro style video game probably, the dinosaur game on chrome when you are offline or couldn't connect to the internet is my inspirition.</p> 
    <p>But it might be too simple, I want to add some fun stuffs on there.</p> 
    <p>That's all for what's in my mind for this week's weekly.</p>
