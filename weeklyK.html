    <p>Yep, this semester is almost over.</p> 
    <p>Looking back to week one, the time we were introduced what html is, and write the very first "Hello World" in html.</p> 
    <p>Also the use of github and visual studio code, are all start of this class.</p> 
    <p>I took a look at what I wrote for weeklyA, I wrote that how I learned to insert hyper text in html and html5.</p> 
    <p>And all these weeklys, are record of what I have learned this semester.</p> 
    <p>It's a surprise that how much stuff I have created and learned.</p> 
    <p>From how to insert a youtube link into a html to how to create a simple game.</p> 
    <p>And these weeklys as well as the class website can defintely show the progress of me learning html, css, and p5js.</p> 
    <p>What I learned in this class is all useful and important knowledge, like I have used them to create my own website.</p> 
    <p>Also, the coding part, all the practices, are just important as other things.</p> 
    <p>For me, it's more like a review, but I have also learned new things.</p> 
    <p>Of course, there were many problems, issues, bugs that have occured when writting the code, but just like learning other things, </p> 
    <p>I need to do research, trying to fix things to achieve what I want to achieve.</p> 
    <p>This kind of process is also really helpful.</p> 
    <p>Overall, I like how this course is organized and teached, wonderful experience, and I hope I will use the things I learned instantly.</p>
