    <h1>Weely F Blog For ART 3001</h1>
    <h2>By Tony Wang</h2>
    <h3>03/19/2023</h2>
    <p>This week is our spring break, so besides catching up some work, I went to Cleveland and watched a NBA game, Cleveland Cavaliers played against Philadelphia 76ers.</p> 
    <p>I went to Cleveland couple times past few years during my college times, it is a beautiful city, even though every time I went there was all for Cavaliers games.</p> 
    <p>But I also did many other things during this spring break.</p> 
    <p>I bought a domain for two years, so that I can have my own website, not building it from the github server.</p> 
    <p>This website is intended to be a simple portfolio website, no complicated stuff and just for displaying my works.</p> 
    <p>I think at this point I have learned a lot to build a nice portfolio website, and of course there are many external helps.</p> 
    <p>It's nice to have some fun, taking a break from school works, but there are many things due at the end of the break, just like this weekly blog as well as the drawing exercise using p5js.</p> 
    <p>As the main assignment during the break, there are many stuffs I want to do using p5js, but the limitation on using for loops and such really limited the things I want to do.</p> 
    <p>Then I have to limited my ideas to simple shapes animation, and user interactions by using p5js.</p> 
    <p>So I did a little endless animation on the top of the canvas and some other interactions using mouse and clicking.</p> 
    <p>I believe that by using for loops and other, I will be able to create a small website game, so I am looking forward to the next exercise or project.</p>
